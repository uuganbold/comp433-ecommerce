## Goal 
In this project, we implemented our eCommerce systems's web api. 

This project is hosted on github.com : [Github.com Repository](https://github.com/uuganbold/comp433-ecommerce)

The client is deployed on the AWS : http://18.223.188.97/ 
The webservice is deployed on the AWS : http://18.223.188.97:8080/ecommerce/   

## State diagram
State of creating order functionality would be below.

## Architecture

We are using springframework as an architectural framework and Hibernate as an ORM framework.
This webapp's architecture would be seen like below so far.

![Architecure](../dev/architecture.png)

The application has three layers: Service, Domain, and Data access layer<br/>

### 1. Service Layer:

This layer (**in api directory**), generally contains three kinds of objects.
* Web Services (as for RESTful - Resources) - We implemented Web services with both SpringMVC (RestControllers) and
and CXF (Resources) just to learn them.
* Payloads - Mapped objects of information received from clients (Requests) and information sent to clients (Representation)
* Activities (workflows) - The interface to access to domain layer. Performs external logic of the system. It maps payloads into DTO and vice versa. 

### 2. Domain Layer:

This layer contains three kinds of objects. 
* Models (**in domain dir**) -  Performs internal business logic along with Domain Services. We implemented them with Hibernate Entities.

Entity Relationship Diagram would look like below.

![ERD](../dev/COMP433-Ecommerce.png)

* DTO (Data Transfer Objects) - Represents information sent to service layer and received from service layer.
We use this objects for that purpose instead of using Entities for reasons listed below. 
    1. Entities contains business logic within them and we does not want to expose those logic to service layer.
    2. In our case, Entities can access directly Data Access layer. So we would have allowed service layer 
     power to stimulate data access operations.
     
* Domain Services - Performs internal business logic along with Models.

### 3. Data Access Layer:

We implemented Data Access Layer with Spring-Data-Jpa Repositories. So we have Repository object for each and every Entities.
These Repositories are responsible for accessing Database and persisting the entities.
